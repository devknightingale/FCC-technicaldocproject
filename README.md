# FCC-technicaldocproject

Part of the Legacy Responsive Web Design certificate from FreeCodeCamp. It took a lot more work than I thought it would with how simple the page looked on the outside. 
I learned a lot about how complex CSS positioning can be. It seemed I tried a dozen ways to do the same thing before I found the one that worked. 
Then, I'd test something, and it would break. So I'd have to go back and try to figure out what part of the code was breaking it. 
It was definitely a learning experience though, and I think that's probably the main point of projects like this. You don't really learn a thing until you do it yourself, and that means making mistakes and learning how to fix them on your own. 
It's still not a beautiful page by any means, but it works!
